# Otto Blockly Web (Only) Version

For The Electron (Original) Version see the main project https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly

This is a free and open source visual programming language based on Blockly from Google & MIT, Arduino codes are created by just combining the blocks, then they are compiled (check or verified) and quickly [upload to any Otto robot](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/projects) or similar Arduino(C++) or Micro:bit or Python robots.

Thanks for your contribution.

## More Languages

We are translating Blockly for Otto for the international community, you are welcome to contribute with the languages you know, it will benefit you and everyone in your community.

The more people helping to translate the better, it is important to translate while understanding the context, or what is the robot actually doing, to be accurate.

1. Go to [lang folder and duplicate the Arduino_en.js Blockly_en.js and msg_en.js  files from english](https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly/tree/master/www/lang), 
2. Rename them according to your ISO language code, for example fr is for French,so the files are renamed like this: Arduino_fr.js Blockly_fr.js and msg_fr.js  
3. Edit the files with any code editor software like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) translating only the english part after = in between the quotes "" in visual studio is the text in red.
4. Then pull a request here in github or just send us the files.
